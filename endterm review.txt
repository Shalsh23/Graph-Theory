CSC/MA/OR 565 FINAL EXAM INFORMATION
************************************
Thursday, April 28, 8:00 - 11:00 a.m.

Cumulative, covers all lectures and associated material in the text,
including about 15-20% on material covered since exam 2.

About 8-10 questions.

Closed book, no calculators, no notes,

Suggestions for preparation: (no special order)

        - Study exams 1 and 2 and quizzes
        - Study posted solutions to homework problems
        - Review notes, outline major results and techniques
        - Practice on review questions for exams 1 and 2        
        - Think about problems at the end of each section in text

What questions would you ask if you were preparing a final exam for the
course? Maybe you could ask them of each other.  Upon request a message board for Final Exam preparation can be set up.

Some Review Questions for Exam 2
********************************************

1.  We showed that the greedy algorithm for vertex coloring never uses more
than max degree plus one colors.  Can the same be said for greedy edge coloring in a simple graph?

2.  If G is an n-vertex simple graph with minimum degree at least n/2, must G
be connected?

3. Definition 7.1.11 in the text defines a simple graph to be Class 1 if its
edge chromatic number is its maximum degree and Class 2 otherwise.
For which values of n and k is H_{n,k} Class 1?  Class 2?

4.  Same question as 3 for T_{n,k}.

5.  Vizing's theorem requires that the graph be simple.  In the proof of
Vizing's theorem, where is the first step that would not be valid for a
non-simple graps?

6.  Study the proof of Hall's theorem and check whether it still holds if G is
not simple.  What about Corollary 3.1.13?  Why am I asking this question in
the context of edge coloring?

7.  In a proper edge coloring of a simple graph G, the edges colored the same
color form a matching.  Use this fact and a counting argument to prove that
when n is odd, K_n does not have a proper n-1 edge coloring.

8.  What is the fat triangle and what is interesting about it?

9.  Prove or disprove:  Any simple connected graph with an odd number of
vertices must be Class 2.

10.  What about any simple connected regular graph with an odd number of
vertices - must it be Class 2?

11.  Adapt Proposition 7.2.3 into a necessary condition for a graph to have a
Hamiltonian path.

12.  Problem 7.2.8 in the text.

13.  Problem 7.2.2, text.  Do any of our necessary or sufficient questions
determine this?

14.  Problem 7.2.12, text.  Do any of our necessary or sufficient questions 
determine this?

15.  Find the closure of the two graphs in problem 7.2.36.

16.  Show why these two graphs fail Chvatal's condition.

17.  For which n and k are the Turan graphs Hamiltonian? In each case show
which (if any) of our necessary or  sufficient conditions apply.
