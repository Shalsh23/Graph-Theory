Exam 2 - Tuesday, April 5

Closed book, closed notes, no calculators, cell phones, cameras, etc.
Space for scratch work will be included with the exam.

Covers network flows (4.3), graph coloring (5.1,5.2), planar graphs (6.1, 6.2), and coloring planar graphs(6.3)

Be familiar with (memorize) all definitions theorems, lemmas, corollaries, 
propositions that are included in the class notes. 
(Look for their precise wording in the text.)
Be ready to apply these to solve problems.

Study suggestions:

- Study solutions to homework problems.  Make sure you understand the
questions they are asking and any subtleties involved in their solution.
Think about how you could improve solutions 
now that you know more graph theory or now that you have more
expertise in formulating proofs.  Think about how you might have
said things better or with fewer words or more precisely by using
the terminology and tools (results) we have been developing.

- Review the results, proofs, proof techniques, and examples discussed 
in class and make sure you understand every step.

- Practice working problems from the text (there is a forum on the
message board to share & check answers).  If you really understand 
what is going on, you find all the problems marked "(-)" easy.

- Practice on the Review Questions below.

- Upon request, a message board could be set up to share & check answers to problems
you are working on to practice for the exam.

Some Review Questions for Exam 2
********************************************

It goes without saying that all of the answers (1) should be justified and
(2) should be justified using graph theory.  Remember, on the exam you
are trying to show how much you have learned.


1. What is the main result about network flows?  What are the main tools and
how are they used?  Describe an algorithm for finding a maximum flow.
What is a feasible flow?  What is a source-sink cut?  What is a flow 
augmenting path?

2. Given a network and a feasible flow, can you find all of these: 
	the value of the flow
	the set of vertices joined to the sink by a path of positive tolerance
	a flow augmenting path

3. Given a network, can you find all of these:
	the capacity of any specified cut
	the maximum feasible flow
	the value of the maximum feasible flow
        a source-sink cut of minimum capacity
	the capacity of the minumum source-sink cut

4. How can you *prove* that a given flow f is maximum?  (There is only  one
good graph theory answer to this question.  Don't say "because there
are no f-augmenting paths".)

5. Given a flow, f, let S be the set of vertices reachable from the source,
	s, by paths of positive tolerance.

	What can you say about f if the sink t is in S?
	If t is not in S, show that the value of f is the same as
	the capacity of the cut [S, V-S].

6. What is the difference between k-chromatic and k-colorable?
What is the difference between  k-chromatic and k-critical?
Give example to highlight the differences.

7. Does every k-chromatic graph have a k-critical subgraph?
Why or why not?

8. What is greedy coloring?  Give an example to show that it is not
necessarily optimal.  How is greedy coloring used to show that
the chromatic number of a graph is never more than its maximum
degree plus 1.

9. If G is critical, what can you say about an upper bound on its
chromatic number?  How is this different from the non-critical case?

10. Give an example to show that G can contain an odd cycle and yet
still have chromatic number smaller that its maximum degree.
Why doesn't this contradict Brooks' theorem?

11. Show how greedy coloring + the tree trick work to prove Brooks'
theorem when the graph is not regular.

12. Give example of critical graphs for several different chromatic
numbers.

13. Can you find a relationship between the chromatic number of a graph
and the chromatic number of its complement?

14. Find a graph with chromatic number 5, but with no 3-cycles.

15. Suppose you start with C_3 and apply the Mycielski construction.
Do you still get a graph with chromatic number 4?

16. In the construction of the proof of Theorem 5.2.3, how many vertices
does the k-chromatic graph have?  How many edges?

17. How many edges are in the Turan graph T_{n,k}?
Suppose a simple graph G has 20 vertices and chromatic number 5 and
G is d regular.  What can you say about d?

18. Are the Turan graphs critical?  What is their vertex connectivity?
Their edge connectivity?

19. Can subdividing an edge in a graph change its chromatic number?  Explain.
Can contracting an edge increase the chromatic number?

20. True or false:  Let e be an edge of simple graph G.  Let H be obtained
from G by contracting edge e.  Then if H contains a subdivision of
K_{3,3}, so does G.

21. True or false:  Let e be an edge of simple graph G.  Let H be obtained
from G by contracting edge e.  Then if H contains a subdivision of
K_{3,3}, so does G.

22. Prove that a simple planar graph has minimum degree at most 5.

23. Which of the Harary graphs are planar?

24. Which of the Turan graphs are planar?

25. Suppose we have a map in which every state shares a boundary with exactly
3 other states.  Must $G$ be 3-colorable

26.  Use graph theory to analyze the possible planarity of the 4-cube and
of its complement.

27.  Prove which of these combinations are possible/impossible:
For simple graph G, and edge e of G: G contains (does not contain)
a Kuratowski subgraph, while G dot e contains (does not contain) a
Kuratowski subgraph.

28.  What can be said about the minimum degree of a planar graph?

29.  Outline the proof of Kuratowski's theorem, in particular how it
follows from Tutte's theorem, how the pieces fit together.

30.  Use the "conflicting chords" argument to show that K_{3,3} is nonplanar.
Can you generalize the "conflicting chords" to show that the Petersen
graph is not planar. (Start with a long cycle C.  Delete the edges
of C.  You could think of the nontrivial connected components as
a generalization of chords.  But then what does "conflict" correspond to?

31. How does the proof that every planar graph is 5-colorable start?
Use this idea to give a simple proof that every planar graph is
6-colorable.

32. Problem 6.3.1, text - use the strategy of the proof of the Five Color
Theorem.
